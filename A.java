Global Research currently has a client facing web portal, mobile and tablet apps developed and hosted by Markit Digital (previously Markit on Demand).  The client portal is the foundation of distribution of research to clients and hence absolutely critical to the functioning of Global Research department. This project is to bring the client portal in-house, leveraging the CIB Channels Foundation Services.  This is being done as Markit Digital has proved to be inadequate.
The main objective of this project is to improve reliability, improve performance and reduce ongoing cost by migrating the current Research portal from vendor managed model to an internally developed and maintained model.
